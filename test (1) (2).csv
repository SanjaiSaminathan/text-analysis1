(or, do you not concede that, hypothetically, a VALID, proper rule can be MISINTERPRETED and/or MISAPPLIED?).  Merely citing the RULE is pointless, when the problem is the misinterpretation or misapplication of the rule!NEWLINE_TOKEN:: Further, Dodo violated WP rules, by not allowing a consensus of the group to develop.  He also misapplied a rule, claiming that something I said must be 'verifiable'.  But what does it mean, to be 'verified'?  Dodo implied that what I said must be verifiably, scientifically TRUE.  I claim, quite to the contrary, that since the article involved is 'Jim Bell' (subject, ME), that the only 'verifiability' issue is this:  Did 'James Dalton Bell' ACTUALLY make these claims.  (Or, conversely and hypothetically, 'is someone else forging his identity?, etc.)   For example, there was no need to RUSH and delete my posts.  Rather, somebody (preferably, one familiar with LOGIC) could have said, ``Bell, how do we know that 'you', 'jimdbell@q.com', is in fact the 'jim bell' (James Dalton Bell) who is the subject of the 'Jim Bell' WP article?  We need to be able to VERIFY the fact that 'jim bell' actually said/did this.`` (To ensure that 'jim bell' is not being libelled by a stealth forgery.)NEWLINE_TOKEN::In response, I would have immediately said, ``Good question!``  And I could have promptly proceeded to do whatever was necessary to establish this fact.  Perhaps I could also have donated a recent (current!) photograph to the article, which (of course) could be compared with other published (even if not public domain) photographs which are available on the web.   NEWLINE_TOKEN::But as John Belushi was so fond of saying, 'BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO!'  Rather than HELP a 'newbie' (to WP), AND wait for a consensus, and actually help VERIFY that 'jimdbell@q.com' is actually, 'jim bell', Dodo decided to be an ass and repeatedly delete my edits.  And, he deleted ALL my edits, not merely some portion which (allegedly) was not 'verifiable'.  I will give an example, to the contrary:  I also posted a claim that I accused the Feds of forgery in a criminal appeal case, 99-30210.  In fact, in June 2003 I wrote a lawsuit (195 pages) which has (I believe) LONG been posted on the Web.  (Probably Cryptome/JYA).  It (as I recall) makes exactly this accusation.  So, if Dodo had actually acted INTELLIGENTLY, he would have edited my edit to cite my lawsuit, which has been posted for perhaps 5+ years.  (Or, he would have said to me, ``Bell, you need to show a cite of your lawsuit...``).  THAT would have been productive, useful, and helpful.  (As opposed to being hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.)   So, why didn't Dodo do THAT?!?   The answer is quite simple:  Dodo is hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.  He's a 'control freak'.  (Apparently, WP attracts 'control freaks'.)

However, you can't guarantee what is the exact year. They are Spaniards, but they have not to be the first Spaniards in the Yucatan, just the first in the lands of the Mayan city-state that is shown in the movie. Spaniards with smallpox can have arrived in other part of the Yucatan and infect the people there, and later these people could extend the sickness to other regions through trade or war. The Southern Ming never visited Europe, but their Black Plague destroyed 1/3 of the European population, and the Incas fell on civil war because an epidemy of smallpox in Mexico extended to South America and killed the emperor and his heir. I suppose that you understand what I'm trying to say.

Others make that jump based on the dialect that the director choose to use.  If language in the movie is the only thing that ties where the story takes place to the Yucatan then I would argue that Gibson only used the dialect because it is still a living language used by many of the extras in the cast.

By the way, RedPeacock. If you ever want something REALLY entertaining to do, I would suggest going to the Keith Olbermann article and looking at the now-infamous “criticism” section in the talk page.

I reviewed it, after this deletion.  The OP said something like ``Geez, if I had to do life in prison, I'd rather die ... or I'd rather kill myself`` (or some such).  Medeis took that as a suicide threat.  And did the ``threat of harm`` removal.  The policy cited states something like ``take all threats seriously, don't assume that the threat is a joke``.  I did not think it applied to that particular thread.  But, in picking and choosing my battles, this is not one of them.  Anyone  including me  might say ``I'd rather die than serve life in prison``.  In fact, most people would say that!  And I don't think that constitutes a threat of suicide.  Particularly  by the way  given the fact that I (or the OP) did not in fact receive a life sentence.  A silly deletion.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBack to double jeopardy.  We seem to disagree.  And I do not have the wherewithal to engage in legal research at the moment.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYes, it is my understanding that when a new trial is ordered, everyone starts from scratch, from square one.  (I am sure we both recognize that many things can happen in an appeal.  They are rarely cut-and-dry; they are rarely black-and-white.  But, in the cut-and-dry case of ``new trial is ordered``, it is my belief that the prosecution starts with a clean slate and that nothing is ``off limits``.  I say this as a general rule.  Perhaps the death sentence has some ``extra special``: rules associated with it.  But, even that, I am suspect of.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn your case where the defendant is actually acquitted (on one charge), of course no retrial can occur (on that charge).  But, again, it depends on the appeal.  I am quite certain that the defense did not appeal the acquittal.  I am sure he appealed the ``rest of the trial`` which did not favor his client.  So, in other words, the charge acquitted (assault and battery, in your example) is not even under consideration in the appeal.  An appeal usually has several points being appealed (not just one).  And the justices review each point, one by one.  So, in your hypothetical case, the defense would not be ``complaining about`` (i.e., appealing) an acquittal that went in their favor.  They would be appealing the other things that transpired in the trial.  So, the final order of the justices might read ``a new trial is ordered with respect to the robbery charge`` (or some such).

Both are presented at two removes from the original. Cézanne's portrait of his wife is transposed, with significant but subtle alterations, from a diagram book, Cézanne Composition, published a quarter of a century earlier, Lichtenstein was amused by the oversimplified and paradoxical idea that a flat diagram consisting solely of thick black outline could be used to represent the Frenchmen's work, given Cézanne's insistence on eliminating contours from his paintings as incapable of suggesting the corporeal reality of the three-dimensional motif from which he was working.``NEWLINE_TOKEN*(Deitcher, David. ``Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist``.) ``The contradictory character of the Pop object was central to an unusually lively and revealing debate late in 1963.

Reviewing the artist's second Pop show in the New York Times, O'Doherty labeled him 'one of the worst artists in America.' Nonetheless, he also credited him with creating paintings that 'raised some of the most difficult problems in art.' O'Doherty took note of an argument that had just erupted in the art press: the September issues both of Art News and Artforum had run angry features about Pop art in general and Lichtenstein's work in particular.``NEWLINE_TOKEN*(Deitcher, David. ``Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist``.) ``...Erle Loran, who had targeted two paintings by Lichtenstein, Portrait of Mme. Cézanne and Man with Folded Arms (both 1962), in order to excoriate some of the salient features of the new art. Each painting was a characteristically brazen blowup of a diagram from Loran's book Cézanne Composition, then twenty years old.``NEWLINE_TOKEN*(Deitcher, David. ``Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist``.) ``Both Loran and O'Doherty thought it absurd that so many supporters of Pop were defending Lichtenstein by insisting that he 'transformed' rather than 'copied' his sources. Claiming that only an expert could discern the difference, O'Doherty found this hairsplitting quite beside the point. After all, it had been possible to classify direct appropriation as art since 1913, when that 'old master of innovation ,' Duchamp had 'started it all by setting up his readymades...and calling them art, leaving on us the burden of proof that they were not.' Both Loran and O'Doherty found the transformation alibi doubly annoying since it clinched the matter of Pop's high-cultural status by resorting to an altogether academic and contradictory dual defense. On one hand, Pop was art because it 'put a frame of consciousness around a major part of American life...we take for granted.' On the other, Pop was art because an artist like Lichtenstein transformed his sources 'like a good artist should'—a clichéd view of fine-art production.``NEWLINE_TOKEN*(Deitcher, David. ``Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist``.) ``For Loran, the 'transformation' or 'copy' debate was spurious: since the Abstract Expressionists had ventured 'far beyond the process of transforming nature' to produce paintings that presupposed 'no conscious source but have an identity and imagery that is autonomous,' transformation—even were it detectable in Lichtenstien's art— could only constitute aesthetic regression.``NEWLINE_TOKEN*(Deitcher, David. ``Unsentimental Education: The Professionalization of the American Artist``.) ``For different reasons, Lichtenstein himself shunned the transformation defense.``NEWLINE_TOKEN;Coplans, ed.NEWLINE_TOKEN*(Coplans, ed.) ``The idea of using a closely linked subject matter within a unified style of treatment is obviously suggested in the various paintings deriving from modern masters. Man with Folded Arms and Portrait of Madame Cézanne (both 1962) are quotations of outline diagrams by Erle Loran explaining Cézanne's compositional methods and are similar in the linear black-and-white handling of the imagery.``NEWLINE_TOKEN  : EDATA_8",test,1,-1

It states that there is a ``lack of consensus`` and ``robust evidence`` within the medical literature for things such as penile cancer, STI and UTI, while maintaining there is evidence for HIV prevention (at least in the African trials). If I had the time I would be tempted to run a statistical analysis on the medical reviews themselves! I suspect there would be a clear correlation betweeen the conclusions reached and the country from which they originated. Which brings us (in my opinion) to the crux of the matter. Rightly or wrongly, this is primarily a ritualistic or cosmetic procedure, regardless of what evidence or opinion the medical community has, or will provide. Therefore, to treat this as almost an entirely statistically based article, while only giving a cursory nod to the ethical debate, just feels wrong to me. I am certainly not advocating any bias either for or against. I would be happy to see quotes from Rabbis, Imams, surgeons and scholars. I also believe that any medical consensus (if proven) should remain the basis of the article. Perhaps a sub-heading of ``controversy`` may be worthwhile? `  : EDATA_8",test,0,-1

CPT is promoted by some PhD creationary scientists, problems with it are noted by other equally degreed creationists.  Flooding is by tsunami from oceans, rains are a side product.  Asteroid impacts are credited in two models  Asteroid impacts w/CPT and Asteroid impacts w/vertical tectonics.  There are critics of both among creationary scientists.  Flooding is by tsunami from oceans, rains are a side product.  Discussions of these models are found in creationary publications, which are, of course, automatically rejected as FRINGE so.......

And while I agree a source is not often 100% reliable, especially one relying on opinion...3 major sources IS. Especially given they're frequently used accross Wikipedia. Van Halen began as a hard rock band with a heavy metal edge at times...but ``Dreams`` is definitely a pop rock song. Generally the 1984 album is considered the one where the band became poppier, and in the Sammy Hagar era that really took root. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPower ballads are the most common pop rock crossover out there.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOh, and a lot of their covers were poppy songs anyway, like You Really Got Me.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have some more stuff below, but first, look at this.

Which is pop metal by the way, making it hard to classify. They went the commercial side of things and moved away from metal. Guns N' Roses, again, sleaze rock. Something that formed from the ashes of glam metal - but Guns N' Roses were among the first. So the line between sleaze and metal blurs with them. They ARE the crossover point. AC/DC I'd not call metal, and I think KISS had a few metal songs but don't really count...but they are heavily disputed the two of them. Opinions on either carry little weight. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia has several definitions for pop rock: ``Pop rock is a subgenre of rock music that uses ``catchy`` pop style, with light lyrics over top of ``guitar-based`` songs``. I would say that sums up some of Van Halen's stuff to a t. ``they only use pop hooks or synths to appeal to both a hard rock and pop audience from time to time``? Have you heard their latter-day singles? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Sure they used synth, and sure they've used pop hooks, but haven't countless other hard rock and heavy metal bands done so?``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt most frequently happened in glam metal. Which is aka pop metal. Glam metal is a genre a lot of people wanted to attach to Van Halen, personally I think just because something's pop rock and heavy metal at different times does not make it pop metal. Hence my desire to keep pop rock - the comparisons to glam metal are made obvious that way. It's hard to ignore them, but also impossible to just call it glam metal.`  : EDATA_8",test,0,-1

It is one of about 85,000 historic sites or objects and historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).  There about 2,500 sites and objects and historic districts that are NHLs, including the California Liberty ship SS Jeremiah O'Brien.  Note, the ship is included in a Wikipedia NRHP list for its geographic area, but it is not included in the Wikipedia NHL list for Maryland.  It is understandable that you would not know the distinction.  But, looking for the John W. Brown in search screens for NHLs cannot lead to success.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::You did do well to find that Maryland Historical Trust webpage.  I happen to know that is a summary by them of the full NRHP nomination document, from my having gone through detailed comparisons of other such webpages to actual NRHP documents which are available online for some Maryland sites (including the NHL ones), in consultation with editor Pubdog a while back.  Pubdog developed most of the articles about NRHP-listed places in Maryland (indexed here).  I asked Pubdog to comment here on this page, and perhaps that would have helped.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::The NHL URL that you reached, http://www.cr.nps.gov/nhl/REGIONS.htm, seems pretty good to me.

I confirm that you found a bad link from that page;  when I click on Questions/Answers there i too see that it links to http://www.nps.gov/nhl/QA which just gives an error message.  However you do already have all the phone and email contact info you need to ask about any National Historic Landmark.

They, the cro-nationalists, are those same ones who ruined one respected and progressive country like Yugoslavia and never regreted it. Even today they openly attack everything connected with Yugoslavia, including the ever growing collaboration and new started unification process of the former yugoslav peoples. They are the same ones, who sent their terrorists to crash yugoslavian planes in 1970's and spread hatred and separatism between ex-Yugoslavians. And now, since all the world stood against them, they're playing their dirty game with the Serbocroatian language, finding some non-existing matters, with only to them known quazi-``sources``. People originating from South East Europe can easily recognize and stop them, something that wikipedia should probably do too. I am actually surprised how I didn't get any support from the administrators from Srbocroatian wikipedia, because whenever something like this happened before they would have cut the cro-nationalist's edits off in the next minute:)). I hope they will do it again, whenever they are aware of what's going on. Anyhow, I wish you all the best in your editing on wikipedia, if I have time in the future - I'll join it as an editor too, and at the end I want to repeat again:- please control the cro-nationalists on wikipedia as much as you can because they are nothing but distructive elements of a defeated nationalistic propaganda, and who behind the mask of 'good people' have always some 'hidden agenda' that they're working on, luckilly with no effect.

If there are scholarly sources that state that early Buddhism included a belief in Brahman as it is currently understood by Hindus, then attribute the statement to the source and indicate where it originates.  Furthermore, the place where that line is added (``So then...``) still makes no logical sense.  In a paragraph where what is being discussed is the use of the same word to hold different meanings by the Buddhist and Hindu tradition, presenting ``so the historical Buddha believed in this Hindu concept`` as a conclusion- particularly without citation- is an absolute non sequitur.  Further, you are still not understanding my point regarding altering cited text.  It seems (though I don't have access to the source) that we have one source that is saying that there is a consensus regarding the dating of the Bhagavad Gita.  If that consensus does not exist among scholars, than surely there must be an academic source that states outright that such a consensus does not exist.  If you wish to alter the statement that provides dating for the BG, you need to provide a source which demonstrates that the previous content is incorrect or under dispute.  We simply need to be clear about attributing- both in terms of sources, and in terms of who holds these particular beliefs- the ideas in this article, rather than adding sweeping statements that claim to present the 'true' teachings of Buddha.  None of us have the 'true' teachings of Buddha- what we have are traditions that have been passed down and interpreted over the years.  Each tradition has its own opinion on what the true situation is.  Wikipedia's role- and ours as editors- is not to decide which one is correct, but to present objectively the views of the different sides.   `  : EDATA_8",test,0,-1

Reported and linked by Slashdot and other press sources as a unique and spontaneous occurence in Wikipedia history, it has apparently had some impact as, despite being scheduled to begin in January, not a peep has been heard about the trial and proposed sponsored link since the deal's controversial announcement months ago. Currently, however, there is an attempt to delete the project or move it off Wikipedia altogether. Since the Foundation has provided no additional information and has not attempted to answer the specific questions that participants in the project raised, it is unclear if the Answers.com deal has been abandoned or simply delayed.

If a conspiracy theory is a theory involving a ``coordinated group`` which ``is, or was, secretly working to commit illegal or wrongful actions, including attempting to hide the existence of the group and its activities`` then Operation Northwoods does not fit the criteria. First of all, the CIA does not try to keep its self hidden or secret. It is a known agency and the plans of Operation Northwoods are no more a Conspiracy Theory just because they where kept secret then any of its other actions that the CIA plans or performs on a daily basses that are all kept secret from the general public. Secondly, Operation Northwoods was not a conspiracy within the CIA either. Not one CIA member kept it a secret from anyone who should have known about it. It other words the protocols and the chain of command for this plan was followed precisely as they should have been. And because of that fact, it was shot down, the architect of the plan was fired, the plan never took action and it was well documented which is why we know of the plan under the Freedom of Information Act.

Some theories are that the U.S. government conceals an alien presence because they're afraid of it causing a scare, which sounds more reasonable than, ``to be used for war and other ideas, mainly towards the New World order.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso the fourth section is almost completely dedicated to explaining conspiracy theories in a discrediting manner, treating them like psychological abnormalities or attempts by confused individuals to make sense of a nonsensical world. It seems to be the most common and most annoying criticism of conspiracy theories. This section also is half of the actual article, with the rest mainly being an explanation of the terminology and even mentions of fictional conspiracies. Very little of this article goes to treating conspiracy theories as a justifiable practice in critical thinking that like all legitimate studies can lead to rather ridiculous theories. For instance, there are legitimate questions about 9-11, such as the $100,000 given to Atta by a head of the ISI. There are also allegations that the 9-11 Commission due to its structure and the associations of its head with the Administration was unable to do a thorough and independent investigation, with it ultimately being little more than a coverup. In every case critical thinking demands some form of explanation or theory for such facts. For instance one is that the Administration is trying to cover up connections between Pakistan and/or Saudi Arabia and 9-11. This w  : EDATA_8",test,0,-1

While it is a sourced term and is in use by academics as has been demonstrated above, there is a strong refusal to including it. The Greek insistence to including this term is primarily to prevent the much feared monopolisation of the name ``Macedonia`` by Fyrom, whose editors oppose using the term for reasons I have difficulty understanding. I have already said that I'd agree to removing the term ``Greek Macedonians`` (other Greek users haven't) if the disambiguation note were to be expanded so as to avoid the monopolisation.

590431994.0,"SDATA_8 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN:The figure used on this page isn't the number of people who self-identify as ``Black``, it's the estimated number of people with some degree of African ancestry... in Latin America in general and Venezuela in particular these are very different things - ``black`` only applies to people who have sole or predominately African ancestry, while people of mixed ancestry generally consider themselves ``Brown`` (``Moreno``) on the census (presumably this is what you are calling ``mestizo``). If we simply used the ``Black`` figure from the census we'd be ignoring the large number of people who have mixed African and European/Native American ancestry. We can't use the ``Brown`` figure either, as this would include many people who have both European and Native American ancestry but no African ancestry. So the census figures are no good for us and we need to find a different source that estimates African ancestry directly without using the ``black``/``brown`` colour labels. The 20-30% estimation comes from an official document from the Venezuelan government (the Embassy in the US) which specifically states this as the number of people with African ancestry, so is a reliable source for our purposes. If you have an equal or better reliable source that gives an alternative figure then please let me know what it is. NEWLINE_TOKEN:The 100% issue is a red herring - ``mestizo`` and ``African ancestry`` are overlapping categories and can't be added together as if they were distinct... ``mestizo`` in Venezuela means a mixture of European, Native American and/or African ancestry, so some of the people included in ``mestizo`` are also included in ``African ancestry`` and you'd be counting them twice if you added the two together. A better check is that we'd expect ``Afican ancestry`` to be all of the ``Black`` category plus part of the ``Brown`` category, so more than 3% and less than 53% - the 20-30% estimate fits this perfectly.NEWLINE_TOKEN:  `  : EDATA_8",test,0,-1

It also showed that 23% of children whose parents are lesbian or gay have been touched sexually by a parent or an adult, compared to 2% of children from heterosexual families, and that 31% of them have had sex against their will, compared to 8% from heterosexual families. The study stresses, however, that it would be wrong to conclude from its data that the abuser was necessarily one of the parents, or that the abuse had anything to do with the parent's sexual orientation. The study also shows that 12% of those with lesbian parents and 24% of those with homosexual fathers have considered suicide, compared to 5% of those from heterosexual families. Children with homosexual parents are also more than twice as likely to be in therapy ``for a problem connected with anxiety, depression or relationships`` - 19% of children compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. Furthermore, 20% of children with lesbian parents and 25% of children with homosexual fathers have had a sexually transmitted disease, compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. 28% of children with lesbian parents and 20% of children with homosexual fathers are currently unemployed compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. Adult children with homosexual parents are also more likely to smoke marijuana and to get arrested.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDue to the findings, it is very controversial, and that is why my edit here: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Homosexuality_and_psychology&diff;=497579176&oldid;=497039907 and here: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=LGBT_parenting&diff;=497585303&oldid;=497583187 has been undone, simply because another user disagreed and claimed the study is: ``widely criticized and flawed.`` Criticized by whom?

What difference does it make? They are findings from a study; how could a ``talk`` about it make any difference? Do we have to come to an ``agreement`` to put this information into the article itself? And if we don't, we will just ignore it and purposely leave the study out of the article, because somebody's opinion about it disagrees? This is not objective and completely unprofessional, not to mention biased. This is nothing more than intentionally leaving a study out of the article because somebody disagrees with the findings.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere is no valid, honest, objective reason to remove this information from the article, yet I was forced to open a ``talk`` about it because of no other reason than somebody not liking the results of the study. This is unacceptable, yet here I am anyway, opening a ``talk`` about it. So, what is there to discuss? Your opinion disagreeing with the results? That is not a reason and is completely subjective. In other words, it is irrelevant. There is absolutely nothing to talk about.`  : EDATA_8",test,0,-1

Oedipa stood in the living room, stared at by the greenish dead eye of the TV tube, spoke the name of God, tried to feel as drunk as possible. But this did not work. She thought of a hotel room in Mazatlan whose door had just been slammed, it seemed forever, waking up two hundred birds down in the lobby; a sunrise over the library slope at Cornell University that nobody out on it had seen because the slope faces west; a dry, disconsolate tune from the fourth movement of the Bartok Concerto for Orchestra; a whitewashed bust of Jay Gould that Pierce kept over the bed on a shelf so narrow for it she'd always had the hovering fear it would someday topple on them. Was that how he'd died, she wondered, among dreams, crushed by the only ikon in the house? That only made her laugh, out loud and helpless: You're so sick, Oedipa, she told herself, or the room, which knew.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe letter was from the law firm of Warpe, Wist-full, Kubitschek and McMingus, of Los Angeles, and signed by somebody named Metzger. It said Pierce had died back in the spring, and they'd only just now found the will. Metzger was to act as co-executor and special counsel in the event of any involved litigation. Oedipa had been named also to execute the will in a codicil dated a year ago. She tried to think back to whether anything unusual had happened around then. Through the rest of the afternoon, through her trip to the market in downtown Kinneret-Among-The-Pines to buy ricotta and listen to the Muzak (today she came through the bead-curtained entrance around bar 4 of the Fort Wayne Settecento Ensemble's variorum recording of the Vivaldi Kazoo Concerto, Boyd Beaver, soloist); then through the sunned gathering of her marjoram and sweet basil from the herb garden, reading of book reviews in the latest Scientific American, into the layering of a lasagna, garlicking of a bread, tearing up of romaine leaves, eventually, oven on, into the mixing of the twilight's whiskey sours against the arrival of her husband, Wendell (``Mucho``) Maas from work, she wondered, wondered, shuffling back through a fat deckful of days which seemed (wouldn't she be first to admit it?) more or less identical, or all pointing the same way subtly like a conjurer's deck, any odd one readily clear to a trained eye. It took her till the middle of Huntley and Brinkley to remember that last year at three or so one morning there had come this long-distance call, from where she would never know (unless now he'd left a diary) by a voice beginning in heavy Slavic tones as second secretary at the Transyl-vanian Consulate, looking for an escaped bat; modulated to comic-Negro, then on into hostile Pachuco dialect, full of chingas and maricones; then a Gestapo officer asking her in shrieks did she have relatives in Germany and finally his Lamont Cranston voice, the one he'd talked in all the way down to Mazatlan. ``Pierce, please,`` she'd managed to get in, ``I thought we had``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``But Margo,`` earnestly, ``I've just come from Commissioner Weston, and that old man in the fun house was murdered by the same blowgun that killed Professor Quackenbush,`` or something.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``For God's sake,`` she said.

So it was the last of his voices she ever heard. Lamont Cranston. That phone line could have pointed any direction, been any length. Its quiet ambiguity shifted over, in the months after the call, to what had been revived: memories of his face, body, things he'd given her, things she had now and then pretended not to've heard him say. It took him over, and to the verge of being forgotten. The shadow waited a year before visiting. But now there was Metzger's letter. Had Pierce called last year then to tell her about this codicil? Or had he decided on it later, somehow because of her annoyance and Mucho's indifference? She felt exposed, finessed, put down. She had never executed a will in her life, didn't know where to begin, didn't know how to tell the law firm in L. A. that she didn't know where to begin.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Mucho, baby,`` she cried, in an access of helplessness.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMucho Maas, home, bounded through the screen door. ``Today was another defeat,`` he began.NEWLINE_TOKENNEW  : EDATA_8",test,0,-1

Pattaya is clearly a location that is dedicated almost exclusively to sex tourism.  I dont know Phuket that well but well enough it is bigger but probably has alot more non-sex tourists so if I were going to identify a place in Thailand if not the world I would mention Pattaya instead and I am tempted to edit.  I hazard a good guess that on any day there is much more ``sex for money`` going on in Pattaya than Phuket. But for someone considering the phrase ``sex tourism`` as not necessarily pejorative I have to qualify this conclusion.  NEWLINE_TOKENNote that ``bar girls`` in Thailand never refer to themselves as prostitutes and this probably goes for most of the general Thai population also.  Although I beleive that there are words in Thai for prostitute they mostly (at least the girls) prefer to call themselves ``rented wifes`` albeit for ``short time`` rather then ``long time``.  I therefore need to be qualify my Pattaya versus Phuket statistic in order to be accurate as excluding sex between husbands and  rented wifes particularly of the ``long-term`` married western kind that typically eventually end up with a large exchange of capital in the ``wifes`` direction whether during the marriage or at its end or both.  There is no such thing as a free lunch and ``everybody pays for it``. NEWLINE_TOKEN[Note that I neither intend nor consider any of the former comments to be either sexist (note women still get paid less than men and suffer loss of income during pregnancy and child rearing) and moreover consider them culturally aware (particurlay Thailand wise).  The fact is that almost all relationships of a sexual kind are commercial ones! One must be aware that labels, concepts, ideas such as ``sex tourism`` carry suggestions associated with Religion particularly Judeo-Christiam-Islamic (JDI) pejoratives thst underpin much of western if not most of the (Religious) worlds worldviews outside of some tribal, village, usually Buddhist and what I like to call ``Giesha cultures``: e.g. Japan, Thailand etc, versus ``Virgin cultures`` typically (JDI) that often revolve around even int he west to some extend the worhship and praise of female virginity before marriage. (Note that Thai Society is strangely contradictory in this regard  aren't we all!  but then Thai culture too has a long and more recent tradition of polygamy than the west.)  Perhaps some historio-religious criticism of these sorts o pejorative and cultural factors should be entertained in the article proper also.  I hate value laden western (and Religious) labels that dress themselves up psuedo-scientificly as culturally universal.

I do not want to construct something new, only show that there are two classes in common usage: Clifford ring (my name) and Clifford algebra; furthermore, that some inaccuracy occurs because they are not adequately distinguished.  All I'm saying is that there exists a class of objects (Clifford ring) in which no specific subspace is necessarily known as the generating vector space V.  You can hide the identity of the subspace V (and the grading) by ``mysterious relabelling``.  But here is the point: this relabelling truly does hide which of the basis vectors span V; it is possible to form a product for every element in the ring, but impossible to identify the original subspace V used in the construction.  The quaternions are a ring isomorphic to Cℓ0,2(ℝ), which has a 1,2,1 grading structure.  Yet, given ℍ, can you find a unique decomposition with this grading structure?  No.  In a CA, grading specifically refers to a unique/natural decomposition into (I think it is into a direct sum of) 0-vectors, 1-vectors, 2-vectors etc.   19:22`  : EDATA_8",test,0,-1

But there is obviously precedent for having it (e.g. Toronto).  The problem I have with these sections is that they end up including obvious entries (like ``Hogtown`` for Toronto), but then also up end up including nicknames that may be used in some circles but don't have particularly wide usage.  The particular problem here in the Scarborough article is that so many of the nicknames have such a negative connotation  perhaps that's just a reflection of public perception, but I do believe that it does, to a degree, give the reader the wrong impression of the place.  Frankly, I am just waiting for someone to add ``Scandahar`` to the list.

240331058.0,"SDATA_8 :  `. If you want to talk about linguistic issues in the Spanish State, or about terrorist bands linked to nationalism, do so at their right articles. The way you try to shove those topics in an article about ``Nationalities in Spain```` looks like you´re trying to inject your personal, unfavourable to those independentist movements POV in this article. Please stop doing that.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMy dear 81.202.96.146, please stop asking me to stop from doing this or that, for it is not your duty to tell me so. Give your opinion and defend it as you may, as I am doing, and put the full stop after it. Now, it seems that we cannot insert anything here that raises the slightest doubt against the legitimacy of ``those independentist movements``. Sorry, I won't bother creating an article entitled ``Terrorist groups linked to X nationalism``; but I do believe that if there's an article that deals with ``X nationalism`` or ``Nationalities in Y``, which includes ``X nationalism``, it is only right to talk about those terrorist groups. To your accusation:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN# I already assumed above that I was biased, as anyone else (my quote: ``Of course, this I'm saying is only part of the story; but it corresponds with the same reality and nothing about it is being said in this biased article.``).NEWLINE_TOKEN# I haven't edited the article yet, because I think the subject is worthy of a discussion, no matter how ridiculous the article itself seems to me.NEWLINE_TOKEN# Due to 1's `` as anyone else``, your accusation can bounce back at you with a very slight variation: you are trying to prevent obnoxious information about nationalism from entering the article, thus unveiling your point of view... So, what's wrong about it?NEWLINE_TOKEN# The problem with your POV is that you already stated something false about the article to defend your position and I refuted it. Your only answer now is to say that my views should belong to another article.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI don't know what your reasons are for defending the accuracy of this article; clearly not the article itself. My own are simply that, if we are to talk about such a delicate subject as ``nationalities in Spain`` we'd better document ourselves and tell everything that ought to be told.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: Why can´t I ask you to stop doing something I find incorrect? You are in fact, doing the same, by asking me not to do it. See the irony? I wasn´t issuing orders, just asking kindly for you to stop doing that. If you don´t want to, it´s ok.NEWLINE_TOKENBy order:NEWLINE_TOKEN1- Everyone is biased, that´s ok. But Wikipedia is not a soapbox. If you want to voice your personal concerns about ``spanish speakers opressed in Catalonia``, that´s fine with me, but please don´t do it in an eclyclopedical article right? When we contribute to a wikipedia article, it´s not enough to go ``OK I´m biased because I think this and that, so let the battle begin``. No, we try to put aside our differences and be as neutral as possible. I´m not trying to point out my ideas in an article, as if I were hoping to clash with you and eventually ``reach a middle ground`` in the article´s content. No. I´m trying to be objective in this article, and you´re not, because you´re admiting to be biased AND allowing your bias to affect your output in this article.NEWLINE_TOKEN2- That´s very respectful of you, and I think it´s the right thing to do.NEWLINE_TOKEN3- No it doesn´t. I am not trying to push an agenda here. I am just pointing the OBVIOUS LOGICAL fact that articles should talk about the topic they´re about. If I, for example tried to hide the racialist doctrines Sabino Arana had, in an article about Sabino Arana, you could rightfully accuse me of ``preventing obnoxious information`` from getting into the article. But asking for an article named Nationalities in Spain to talk about those nationalities and not about terrorist gangs that claim to defend some of the ideologies that support independentist claims based on the actual nationalities we´re talking about in this article, is just asking for something entirely reasonable. See the far away link between your proposed ``terrorist issue`` stuff and the actual content of the article? As I said, create an article about Terrorist gangs linked to nationalist claims in Spain, and everything will be fine. By your same reasoning, anyone could end up talking about the IRA in an article about Catholicism.NEWLINE_TOKEN4- What did I state that was false? I made only one comment before this one, just to ask you to stop trying to shove terrorist stuff in an article that is not about terrorism. Seems perfectly reasonable to me.

But they are have no bottom end power (only 287 ft-lbs, vs LT1 330), an LT1 can easily eat a brand new 250HP CVPI.  The Caprices ran about 16.0 flat, and averaged around 140 MPH top speed.  However, Most magazines ran low 15 seconds with Impala SS's, and if you go to the track, most LT1's run low 15's stock with ease.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLike I said, in the Police Fleet Magazine I have, there is Ford Dealer that specifically sells brand new modded CVPI's that are designed to run the SAME as a LT1 Caprice.  In the article it does a number of upgrades to the car (exhaust, gears, air intake), and at the end it runs the SAME quarter mile and SAME 0-100 as the LT1 Caprice three year average from MSP.

However, before we take this to a more public review, I would like to hear why you think those images should be allowed to stay.  No point in wasting other editors time, if the images have absolutely no chance of being allowed to stay in the end.  Every image above said that it was taken from somewhere, and that's generally not allowed.  There are some specific exceptions, but I don't see them applying.  You should read the Copyright FAQ, specifically section 1.1 and 4.  If you took something from somewhere and modified it, it would count as a derivative work.  The copyright for the original still applies in that case, so it will not be allowed to remain here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: As for using pictures created by your father, I think most people will accept if you claimed to have his permission (I think there is a more formal way to register the permission, but I wouldn't bother).  You should know, though, that the license tag you selected (public domain) allows anyone in the world to do anything they want with it.  Essentially, you're releasing the copyright.  That's good for Wikipedia, but if you think the picture is of great quality, you may wish to retain the copyright and instead license it with one of the GFDL licenses, which are still accepted on Wikipedia.  If this is something you want to do, I'll be happy to guide you through selecting an appropriate license for your needs.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: In short, it seems you are not entirely familiar with how copyrights work.  Even with a link back to the source, you can't just take the image and use it here.  There are some exceptions that can allow the use of non-free materials, such as fair use (section 5 in the FAQ), but then it would require re-tagging and a detailed fair use rationale.  It doesn't look like any of the remaining images can't conceivably be replaced by free alternatives, and none of them are absolutely essential to the articles they're used in.

I want to make this very clear. I believe that Ron Paul, in general, the group of supporters, some of whom I`ve met while I was on the road, are amazing people. Without any help from the official campaign, Ron Paul supporters have coined the term ``The Ron Paul Revolution.`` They developed the concept for the Guy Fawkes Day money bomb back on November 5th which raised over $4 million. They hired a blimp to fly over New Hampshire to promote the Ron Paul campaign. Last Sunday, they held a tea party, where they broke John Kerry`s single day primary fundraising record by collecting another $6 million. But the downside is, when you have rabid supporters, some of them believe they can speak to their own agendas using the candidate`s name.

221024573.0,"SDATA_8 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN::: Trimming sounds fine, but where a dispute comes up, I would recommend slowing things down.  Focus on one or two specific quotes, and if someone reverts, instead of immediately reverting back, try to come up with a compromise version.  Ditto with the other person reverting, instead of immediately pushing the article back to your own preferred version, try to come up with a compromise.  With each person changing each other's work, rather than reverting, it will probably be much easier to try and come up with a consensus version. Also, use clear, calm, and neutral edit summaries, referring strictly to the article, and not the editors.NEWLINE_TOKEN::: In terms of refactoring, what I was referring to was cases where a particular editor was being referred to.  When a post is phrased such as ``You did this wrong`` or ``He is unwilling`` or ``He's just always stubborn``, then that's getting away from discussing the article content, and is veering off into discussing the editors.  Better is to try and phrase talkpage posts without referring to editors.  Good habits to develop (though they can take  time to get the hang of it), are to avoid the words ``you`` and ``your``. Also, avoid naming specific editors in a post, as that often has the immediate result of making someone defensive, and then they may miss everything else that's said. Instead, when it is necessary to refer to a specific thing that was done, diff the edit without mentioning the editor.  Like, ``I disagree with this edit (diff), as I feel it's a violation of (policy/guideline).  A better way to handle things would be (suggestion)``  I know it may sound a bit confusing to do this, but I have seen that using this kind of third-party discussion technique, can work wonders in de-escalating disputes.  It also tends to make whoever is using the technique, sound extraordinarily calm and thoughtful, even if off-wiki they may be hopping mad. ) It also has the added benefit of making things much easier for administrators to take action.  When an uninvolved admin comes to a page in dispute, and they see everyone yelling at each other, the admin normally assumes that everyone is a bit in the wrong.  The admin won't care ``who started it``, they'll just address things as they see them in that moment.  But if an admin comes to a page and sees five editors discussing things calmly, and one editor being uncivil, then it makes it much easier to figure out how to reduce the disruption.  Caveat: Just because one editor is being uncivil, doesn't necessarily mean that they're in the wrong.  But if the discussion has degraded to the point where all they're doing is name-calling, rather than actually discussing the article, then that's a problem that an administrator can easily address, by removing the non-constructive editors from the discussion.  `  : EDATA_8",test,0,-1

See the entry on Microsoft Office Open XML for an example of what is a better writeup, IMHO.  Keep the Standardization section to the basics of what, when and where, the type of summary info that should be upfront and easily found in an encylopedia entry.  Put the debates or other side issues in their own section.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso, a comment by a member of OASIS does not necessarily reflect OASIS policy or even the majority view of the ODF TC.  It is just one person's opinions at one point in time.  The use of the word ``rushed`` needs to be subtantiated, otherwise it is merely opinion.  Since I can also point to opinions on the web that say that ODF was not rushed, I think we'll both need to acknowledge that this is a debatable point, and either both sides of the argument should be presented, or an unadorned statement of the facts presented.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf we want to state the facts, we could mentioned when the ODF specification started standardization (December 2002), when comments on the lack of spreadsheet formulas were brought up (February 2005) and when the OASIS standard was issued (May 2005).  Was this a sign of rushing?  Or was it merely the case that it was too late in the ODF 1.0 process to take on this additional work?  It is certainly possible for the later to be true without the former.  2+ years for a standard is not typically evidence of rushing.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn any case, my vote would be to move this item to its own section, or perhaps to Standard office document formats debate.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRegards,NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_8",test,0,-1

I've run into similar problems elsewhere, where a few works are cited many times, and it's useful to collect the the full citations into a section, and to have the footnotes cite these works in abbreviated form. In Daylight saving time I addressed the problem by moving those books into the Further reading section, which isn't exactly appropriate, as Further reading is supposed to be for books that weren't used as sources; I attempted to work around the problem by having the first footnote mention the existence of the full citations in the Further reading section. In Philitas of Cos I addressed it by renaming the section that is ordinarily called References to Notes and having a new References section containing the list of full citations; but it's a bit weird and non-uniform to have the section title move to the newly-added section when you need the new section. I vaguely recall seeing an list-of-full-citations section called Bibliography in some other article but that's not appropriate either, as the MOS says that Bibliography is for works written by the subject of the article. I don't know of any useful guideline in Wikipedia in this problematic area. The approach currently taken in Tourette syndrome #References isn't clearly wrong, and is arguably better than what's in Daylight saving time or in Philitas of Cos, not only because it doesn't abuse Further reading and References as titles, but also because it puts the most important references first.     : EDATA_8",test,0,-1

That aside, I take exception to the implication that South Africa ``committed suicide`` in any way by peacefully moving to a sharing of power! The ``aftermath`` of this (series of) battle(s) has been argued to include a hastening of South Africa's movement to the peace table, or conversely that SA hastened the end of the operations in Angola specifically so that the situation at home could be concentrated on. However you look at it, it made political sense to ``abandon the field`` and ``enter negotiations`` voluntarily. I'm not sure what is meant by ``let unita alone`` though? SA supported UNITA through the whole process of peace negotiations and the JMC etc. It was only after the 1994 elections in South Africa that UNITA was truly orphaned.

To get this figure, you probably included all organic content in the lithosphere, as if there was a remote chance to gzet anything usable from a 5 km deep shale with 1% of kerogen. You got confused ``light oil``, and ``conventionnal oil``. what you categorized as ``low-grade oil`` is, for a large part, not oil at all (kerogen). NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSecond, there is a important notion you ignored  net energy yeld. The vast majority of low grade fossil ``fuels``, like deep oil shale, would consume more energy to extract than they would give. Already, the Athabasca oil sands have a self-consumption of about 30% - that could be reduced to some 25% with advanced technology. The small-sclae oil shale projects that were teste had a near-zero net energy yields - except in estonia, but the shales they used were among the richest known.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThird, extraction rate is as important as reserves. Non conventionnal oil (biodegraded oil, bitumen, oil heavier than water...) is very difficult to take out. Kerogen from shale is even worst. Even if these ressources are in the trillions of barrels, they won't provide much help if we can only get a few million barrels out per day.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFourth, non-conventionnal has an high environmental cost. CO2 emeissions on a full-cycle basis (from well to end use) are much higher. There are other problems like the destruction of ecosystems (for open-pit production of both oil shale of oil sands), water use (especially for oil shale), water pollution, disposal of wastes (for oil shales)... These environmental costs would become catastrophic is non-conventional production was to be upscaled to the same range of output than current conventional production.`  : EDATA_8",test,0,-1

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN*2C - Finish the 50-100 campaign articles for 2006 House races.

Build a 2008 comprehensive master page, and set up campaign articles for every race expected to be competitive/notable (that is, every race listed on the master page).

Is that a lie? Nowhere do I accuse him of anti-Semitism (I see that you enjoy twisting around words...hmmm, what a pity.) While User:PZFUN may well be a lover of Jews, that does not mean that he gets a ``free pass`` when he does a weird thing to an article about a well-known rabbi.

What's ``NOR``? I cannot read your mind. I don't accept any of your thinking about how to handle articles that we know nothing about.

I see a few issues here in dispute: NEWLINE_TOKEN::*1) Cold-blooded=stockier draft type vs. cold-blooded=origin in cold climates.  I had learned it as the draft-type definition, but I have seen both definitions in use.  I don't necessarily think they are mutually exclusive.  While I think that the geographical terminology likely defined the core original breeds, with years of interbreeding this becomes messy.  So many breeds have differing degrees of both types.  For example, Warmbloods are not the only mixtures of European and Arabian blood.  Wouldn't this strict definition mean that Quarter Horses would be a type of warmblood? My feeling is that we can say something like: ``The hot-blooded/cold-blooded terminology originally related to the geographical origin of the breed, but now has come to refer to the overall character of the horse or pony.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::*2) Ponies (most if not all) are cold-blooded because they originated in cold climates vs. some ponies are cold-blooded because they are draft-type.  Again, I think we can finesse this without saying that one is right or wrong.

Although, really, come to think of it, lots of ponies are more like little warmbloods...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::*3) Ponies were not used for 'draft' work in general because they were too small.  As I understand it, some pony breeds flourished at times because they were useful as draft horses in the mines.

Sure the British were impressing ``American`` subjects into the Royal Navy and the NATIVE AMERICANS were at times hostile but the Americans weren't saints. To be honest the War of 1812 was one of the biggest disasters America has faced - their invasion of Canada bloodily repulsed, Native Americans supported by the British and Canadians, A British Army torching Washington DC (in retaliation for the torching of York during the winter season) and ending up marching at will around central america doing what they wanted until a peace treaty was signed. American prestige was only ``restored`` after a meaningless battle in New Orelans AFTER THE WAR ENDED. Regardless of what people say, this war did not prove Young America could hold their own against the old world, it showed they bit off more than they could chew in attempting to subjugate and forcibly liberate Canada against the populace's will. Don't forget half the canadian population were loyalists during the American revolution and Britain was fighting the might of Napoleon in Europe, so the War of 1812 was something of a sideline campaign. I may have rattled on a bit here butI think it just goes to show that that section needs rewriting to seem something other than some super-american-patriotic propaganda machine.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:``Meanwhile, British naval officials tried to recover their losses of sailors by capturing Americans.

112745850.0,"SDATA_8 :  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHi.  I will work through an example for you.  In most Western economies, money borrowed to invest is tax deductible.  In other words, you are only taxed on net profits associated with a business or investment venture such as a 'carry trade' in assets, cash, bonds, or commodities.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo let's say the hypothetical 'carry trader', as typically depicted in the financial media, is borrowing Yen at 0%, and investing in US treasuries or overnight repos at 5.25%.  Sounds like a profitable trade, right?  Read on.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow, consider that said trader pays a marginal income tax rate of 40%.  And consider that Japan has been in deflation for the past number of years, at deflationary rate of -1%.  In the same time period, US inflation has been running at roughly 2.5%.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe 'real' cost after-tax cost of Yen = nominal after-tax cost - rate of inflation.NEWLINE_TOKENThe 'real' return on USD assets = nominal after-tax returns - rate of inflation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo, for the Yen borrowing, the calculation is 0% * (1-40%) = 0% - (-1%) = 1%NEWLINE_TOKENAnd for the USD investment = 5.25% (1-40%) = 3.15% - 2.5% = 0.65%NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo the real rate of return on USD investment is 0.65%, while the real cost of Yen borrowing is 1%.  Since the real cost of Yen borrowing exceeds the real return on USD investment, a so-called 'carry trade' should not have an expectation of profit.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHedge funds and other institutional players are usually intelligent enough not to engage in activities that do not have expectations of profit.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENTherefore, it can be argued that all the talk in the financial 'media' or even in the 'Economist' about a so-called profitable 'carry trade' is complete nonsense.  It is true that there might be some speculators who have placed (and done well with) bets against the Yen in recent years since the bubble burst in the 90s, but to confuse such with a profitable 'carry trade' defies logic.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN   : EDATA_8",test,0,-1

I have been here just under 2 months. I have made well over 1000 good contributions to this project, and until this incident, enjoyed my time here very much. This has been a nightmare, and I very much wish to put it behind me.

In the time since the incident, I have not conducted myself in the most appropriate manner. The fact is, that while I may very well owe an explanation, and/or apology for some of it, it has nothing to do with the original block. You mentioned the fact that several other administrators declined to unblock me. Without veering off into another topic, as far as why that is only partly true, the fact is that this is not about what any other administrator has or hasn't done. You were the one who blocked me, and it is only you from whom I can request accountability. In earlier comments, you've made it quite clear that you are willing to be held accountable before your fellow administrators. I however, am asking that hold yourself accountable for your actions to me; the common user, who was affected by a decision that you made. It remains my position, as I have said before, that I did not deserve to be blocked. You blocked me for violating WP:3RR. 3RR clearly states that the removal of BLP violations is an exception to the rule. Furthermore, you stated on my talk page, that I ``should have stopped reverting, and attempted to gain consensus`` on the talk page. WP:BLP states that violations ``should be removed immediately, without waiting for discussion.`` My actions were in line with WP:BLP, and did not violate WP:3RR. Therefore, I am formally, and respectfully, asking that you acknoweledge that although acting in good faith, you erred in judgement when you blocked me.

And how do we censure what is bad? We will argue that developing a humane reputation system ecology can provide better answers to these two general questions — restraining the baser side of human nature, while liberating the human spirit to reach for ever higher goals.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMost social interactions require matching human needs on the one hand, and quality or taste on the other hand: hunting for a reliable mechanic, looking for an interesting book, sifting through potential investments, judging the merits of proposed policies. Drawing from a distributed pool of reputations has the potential to ease the search for opportunities, ideas, friendships, cultural goods, and high–quality services; hand in hand, pressure will increase for honest behavior, competence, and fulfilling subtle human needs. At the same time, more efficient tagging of con artists, sources of spam, untrue claims, and dishonest actions can better sanction antisocial behavior, for the most part in a bottom–up ``distributed court of opinion.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSustained rapid advances in information technology have created unprecedented abilities, which come along with unprecedented dilemmas. Data has never been easier to create and move around, but to make decisions one also needs to understand its context and implications. Just as important is what lies behind its face value, in realms such as speculative bubbles (Chancellor, 2000), shady financial practices (Partnoy, 2004), and the political statements that are the topic of much of our public discourse.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAccess has generally become easier, driven by falling production, communication, and search costs; however, there are consequently far more suggestions, demands, and events to consider, straining our individual information processing capacity. Leaving the computational milieu alone to evolve ``naturally`` is no guarantee that an ideal or even acceptable society–wide information infrastructure will emerge, as Brin (1999), Lessig (2001), Norman (1994), Schenk (1998), Stallman (2002), Walker (2003), and others have warned. To promote an interconnected ecology of socially beneficial reputation systems, conscious design, analytical modeling, and learning from past successes and failures is indispensable.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFiltering tools are still in their infancy — and having a better window to look out at the world can also imply that others can more easily peek in. Search engines speed up finding similar work done elsewhere; collaboration tools from humble mailing lists to community software to advanced groupware aid both individual and collective problem–solving. Yet it seems that for many important issues, all these tools are not keeping up with the increasing scale and number of decisions we must make, leading to what (Homer–Dixon, 2002) has referred to as an ``ingenuity gap.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSheer computation power is not enough — another factor of 1000 in speed, storage, or bandwidth translates to a more modest gain in making better decisions, and perhaps even a net loss in other forms of effectiveness. (Indeed, if the data or assumptions are noisy enough, the programming aphorism of ``Garbage In, Garbage Out`` applies.) Those who seek to use technology or the public space of ideas to advance their own agendas can also leverage increased computation power. There is indeed a technological revolution still in progress, reshaping commercial and social interactions — but its ultimate course will be affected by designers, activists, researchers and civil society at large. As (Fischer, 2002) said:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Peter Drucker argued that ``there is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.`` Adding new media and new technologies to existing practices will not change the consumer mindsets of learners and workers. We need to explore new computational media based on fundamental aspects of how we think, create, work, learn, and collaborate ... New tools should not only help people to do known cognitive tasks more easily, but they should lead to fundamental alterations in the way problems are solved.``NEWLINE_TOKENIn order for computational advances to translate to widespread social advances, the tools must confer the ability to ``think smarter, not harder`` — and use our collective evaluations of what is desirable to steer resources away from unproductive negative–sum games. Human brains provide an analogy: the difference between a moron and a genius lies primarily not in more or faster neurons, but in neurons that are wired together more effectively. In the same way, reputation systems are a generic tool that allow our observations, analysis, and actions to be ``wired together`` more efficiently.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhat is special about the present time?

However, it would be helpful to learn a little more about Green's background (childhood, recent news, and/or quotes by him or about him, etc).  It would also be improved with the addition of a couple of pictures of Green playing basketball to go along with the bio box on the right side of the page.  The article also fails to mention Green's father, who has many times gained as much attention as Danny and is a very significant story involving Danny that is not included in the article.

I actually LIKE writing footnotes, and finding sources for stuff. I enjoyed finding citations and sources for the stuff in the Horse article last night. Might as well add my services to whatever you're working on next...  |  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Well, given your area of interest, why not American Quarter Horse?  Dlh-Stablelignts has been doing some tremendously good work on Gelding also, and so while the veterinary sections are pretty good, the rest of it could benefit from some additional sourcing, though I did a lot of updating and fixing of what was there originally.  That might be another possibility.  Morgan horse could get there with some SERIOUS work.  Have you looked over the criteria yet?   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::: Briefly, I looked them over. I recall that they need lots of citations, in depth and with enough pictures/diagrams to make things easy to understand for the non-initiate. I'm sure there is a lot more. I've got books on the vet or training side of things, but not as many as on horse bloodlines and breed history. You've obviously been working hard on things with the horses, and I figured I'd rather work with you, than have everyone sorta scattered all over working on sixteen different articles. Concentrating on a couple would probably make the work easier and quicker, I would think. Of course, I'm still new at this, but I know my editing is helped when someone else checks over it. Quarter horse might be a bit TOO much, honestly. I'd have to fight hard to not put in all sorts of tidbits on the older horses from before the registry formed... and the history of the controversies behind the registry, and .. well you get the idea. Oddly enough, given my Quarter horse interests, I own Arabians (grins) so I'd love to see the Arabian article make Featured.... but I'm scared to ask how much work that would take! Anyway, now that I've babbled, I'm more than happy to watch you work and help however I can. Certainly don't want to work at cross-purposes.  |  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe internet is my friend on a lot of breed stuff, most ``generic`` horse books actually are quite poor sources with huge inaccuracies.  The breed registry web sites are often much better (though they aren't above POV, at least four different breeds claim to be the descendants of Bucephalus, which is a wholly unverifiable claim! .  You want an easy job, go to List of horse breeds and take a red link to make a new article.  Most in there are stubs, and need expansion, some are red links that aren't even real breeds (For example, you don't want to see the can of whoopa I open when people start claiming that the ``Egyptian Arabian`` is a different breed, BTW(grin)) so checking the horse stubs is always a way to find new mischief.  (Somehow I got drug into editing on Marwari horse, don't ask me how.)  I got [{Arabian horse]] pretty much to GA status singlehandedly, but it took awhile, editing it from a disaster of anti-Arabian POV to GA status over a period of several months, learning all the way.  My panic about putting it up for FA (I actually think it's almost there) is more the vandalism patrolling it will entail and the things that the wider world of wiki editors might take issue with (for example, the controversies section, almost all parts of it were inserted to settle some kind of edit war or POV discussion.  It's needed.).  I'm not sure I am ready to put  the energy into watchdogging it so that some idiot doesn't totally screw it up or, worse yet, restart battles that were settled a long time ago.  Equine nutrition is one I started from scratch, and after an initial panic when an admin felt I overdid the copy and paste and slapped a copyviol on it without warning (which gave me a really bad couple of days scrambling to get it finished), I basically had it ready for GA in about a week, with a few contributions from some other editors like .  All a question of what kind of real life you also want to maintain.  You may want to take a middle tier article you feel comfortable digging into and see what you can to to improve it.  Saddle might be one.  I wrote most of horse training with an eye to making it a simple, basic article with links to articles with more detail on specific techniques, but if you want a real mess to fix, try horse breaking, it's been written by people who really have no clue what they are doing and is such a mess that I don't even know where to start!

66449250.0,"SDATA_8 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== The ``Ethiopian birr model`` ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou suggested to use this model in some cases. In my opinion, it is okay to include a territory in the current part succession box that has some autonomous rights (especially the right to have its own currency, like pre-2006 Montenegro or present-day Kosovo). Therefore, in the case of Ethiopian birr, it makes sense to speak about currency of Eritrea between 1952-1960 and between 1993-1997. between 1960-1993, only Ethiopian administration existed, Eritrea had neither sovereignty nor any sort of autonomous rights. (Saying in 1978 that the currency of Eritrea is the birr is like saying in 2006 that the currency of East Germany is the euro.) The same case of Austria between 1938-1945. Even Ukraine and Belarus represents the same situation during their Soviet Union ``membership``, however, both countries had more or less autonomy and were members of the UN since 1945. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have the fear that the innumerable border modifications in Europe during the XXth century will make huge and complicated succession boxes. For example, after WWII, Slovakia got back not only its Southern territories (Which the 1st Vienna Award awarded to Hungary in 1938), but three villages near to Pozsony / Bratislava (Horvátjárfalu / Jarovce, Oroszvár / Rusovce, Dunacsúny / Cunovo) were awarded to Slovakia (Treaty of Paris) due to strategic considerations. One could say that who cares with three villages, but this territory was part of Hungary between the two world wars - and it is not much smaller than Muraköz (Medimurje)...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo I don't think each territorial change must be mentioned in the succession box. Only mention if the currency of a new country / state / autonomous province etc. (so a state-like subject that has the right to circulate its own currency) appears without precedessor (like Eritrean nakfa after split from Ethiopia in 1993, but unlike Ethiopian birr after split of Eritrea) or disappears without successor (like East German mark after the reunificaton of Germany in 1990, but unlike West-German mark after the reunification).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor example, German mark or deutschmark was the currency of the Federal Republic of Germany between 1948-2001. It would express that East Germany was simply integrated into West-Germany (contrary to the widely used ``reunification`` term), at least from the point of view of the circulating currency. It would also express that Germany is not the successor state of West Germany but the same country with an enlarged territory. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn the case of the pengő, I would simply say that it was the currency of Hungary between 1 Jan 1927 and 31 Jul 1946. Northern Transylvania, Southern Slovakia and Bácska was totally incorporated into the Hungarian administration. Subcarpathia enjoyed some autonomy, but it was very little and cannot be compared to the rights of then-Yugoslav federal states, present day US states or German federal states.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNaturally, this is only my opinion, I would like to know your thoughts.  `  : EDATA_8",test,0,-1

464891135.0,"SDATA_8 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI regret that it has been changed back. I think I have written a clear and correct representation of metahysical libertarianism. Now the passage seems to say again that metaphysical libertarians require a belief in a soul. This is a falsehood of such magnitude which cannot pass. To require a belief in a soul and implicitly require belief in God is anti-democratic, anti-freedom, anti-emotion, anti-religion. Very clearly in metaphysical libertarianism the way to arrive at a conclusion about an agent is by free belief. I have quoted 2 metaphysical libertarian philosophers previously going out of their way saying that they are opposed to evidence, even against philosophical evidence in coming to a conclusion about the agent. But really ALL late medieval monks are generally considered to be metaphysical libertarians. It is also quite obvious that religion centers around FAITH, not around evidence gathering. So I think I have made a fair and correct representation of common metaphysical libertarianism.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut on the other side I do feel I need more support from people here on wiki that what I wrote is a correct and fair representation of common metaphysical libertarian position. Think this through, is the way in which metaphysical libertarianists reach a conclusion about an agent a free way, or a way forced by evidence?

311464830.0,"SDATA_8 :  NEWLINE_TOKEN::I think you don't see what I mean. My concern is not with the content but with the terminology. The word 'basin' has three definitions: a structural/tectonic one, a sedimentary one and a geomorphological one. All three seem in some way to apply to the London Basin (and the exact boundaries of the London Basin may differ depending on the definition!). The word syncline only has one definition, a structural one. The original sentense called an apple a kind of pear. NEWLINE_TOKEN::I agree with you that the synclinal structure is essential and should be discussed, preferably in the header of the article. But a syncline is in itself not a sedimentary basin. It is a structure on its own. The occurence of a syncline at the core of a basin is, however, usually not accidental. When strata are folded, someone may of course think the synclines will form a basin. In nature though, uplift is never quick enough to create structural basins in this way, certainly not at the scale of the London Basin. Erosion will remove the anticlines and sediments will fill the synclines almost instantly (instantly in geologic time). As folding continues, so will erosion and sedimentation. Eventually a structure will form which is both a structural syncline and a sedimentary basin (a basin in the sense of: a place where sediments have accumulated). This model is called syn-tectonic deposition (or syn-depositional folding). As far as I see, this may well be the case for the London Basin, but I am not sure since we haven't found conclusive information in the sources yet.NEWLINE_TOKEN::There is another way how the strata can be folded into a syncline: pre-tectonic deposition (or post-depositional folding). It is important to find out which of the two models applies. The test will be that in a syntectonic basin, the strata will wedge out in the direction of the edges, while in a pre-tectonic basin, the strata will on average have the same thickness everywhere. The outcrop pattern on the geologic map doesn't show the difference, because the map is not detailed enough.NEWLINE_TOKEN::That the older strata of the Chalk are also folded by the syncline is clear, but I don't see what that has to do with the basin on top of them?     : EDATA_8",test,0,-1

The title quote would lead up that block.  Now, to do that with the existing S pages would take a loooot of work, so the easy way is to either do trivia (adding length to page), add to the episode summary (eg 'Episode 1 ``Wow, this is Survivor`` (John)``: blah blah blah'), or add to where they already are (in the episode summary table).

222209880.0,"SDATA_8 :  `:::Agreed, a timeline would be helpful  perhaps a comparative timeline that shows events from both the perspective of the attackee and the attacker.  The major problem I see in doing this is that using only secondary sources, which I assume is desired, will result in an attackee timeline, for events during the attack, that's composed largely of McGonagle's recall of the attack (i.e., COI findings about events during the attack, and their sequence, are almost exclusively based on McGonagle's testimony; and the NSA History Report used the COI findings as a reference source).  So, for the attackee, the timeline may represent the ``official view,`` as reported in NSA's History Report; but its base information source, McGonagle testimony, can be easily shown as being fraught with errors.  Nonetheless, as long it's made clear to readers that the timeline is based on secondary sources, and that there is contention about the reliably of the secondary sources' references, then I suppose it would be a fair representation of the matter.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_8",test,0,-1

19504662.0,"SDATA_8 :  DID CHRISTIANS INVENT SATAN.NEWLINE_TOKENThe idea that Christians invented Satan is lies, propogated by some adherents of WICCA and other pagan believers, we see that the Holy Scriptures that came from Judaism has a book called JOB, so why blame the christians!, rather The Scriptures reveals in Genesis how EVE was tempted by the Serpent, who had refused to worship adam, also later we see that David is tricked into taking a census by SATAN (Old Testament 2 Samuel) later on further we see that Jesus himsels is accused of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul (Satan) by Pharisees, Jesus refutes the accusations of the Pharisees. In the NT we hear that I saw Satan cast out of Heaven as lightning striketh from the east to the West. So also In Revelations we hear that there was WAR IN HEAVEN and St. Michael and all the Loyal Angels to GOD fought against the followers of Satan and the Battle was won by the GOOD ANGELS, revelation also reveals, woe unto man for the Devil has come down to earth, being fierce and wrathful and know his time to be short! Also elsewhere we hear that Satan is likened to a lion on the prowl going to and fro throughout the earth to see whom he can devour. Christ was tempted by the Shaitan 3 times after his Baptism in the desert. So to say that We Christians invented something which was already revealed in Judaism and OT is silly and obnoxious. The Devil had pride, then disobedience, then Jealousy, then slander, then much later we learn that Jesus called the Satan a liar, murderer and thief.NEWLINE_TOKENWhy dont the WICCANS look to Zoroastriaism or other DUALISTIC Religions and see the concept of GOOD VERSUS EVIL in those religions? Why, so that the Christians get the blame for something that actually EXISTS. Even the Muslim believe in a the serpent called Iblis, and even buddhists had a concept for the Evil One called MARA, who was a TEMPTER. Jesus even spoke to St. Peter and said that the Devil had been given permission to sift St. Peter like wheat, whereby Jesus siad that he had prayed for CEPHAS such that he would not enter into temptation. The truth seems to be that the devil was an Arc Angel in Heaven, who became too full of himself, later whe GOD created MAN in HIS OWN IMAGE, GOD requests all the Angels to BOW to ADAM, all do except for ONE ANGEL (later called LUCIFER). He refuses based on himself being made of fire and that Adam is made of clay, however, GOD allows the satan to act as an adversary to mankind as can be seen in JOB, some mention that in ISAIAH: O Lucifer sun of the morning how thou art fallen from the Heavenn is a direct reference to the DEVIL, but I also consider it to BABYLOON, as in revelation, fallen, fallen is BABYLON the GREAT etc. Revelations has many warnings and prophesies concerning those who worship the evil one etc and their name are not written in the book of life. GOD has talks with the SATAN, so SATAN can not be inferred thence to be a non-entity, as GOD does not talk to non-entities. Also some people believe that the DARK SIDE of human nature to be some impersonal evil, others realise that this is negative non-sense. I know that people were possessed by demons, fallen spirits and that Jesus cast some of them out and they came out screaming 'Ha, Jesus you Nazorean, what hast thou to do with us, hast thou come before the alotted time to torture us!', Jesus then would tell the demon/s to shut up or be quiet!

This becomes a critical issue over time since someone who is paid can keep arguing forever, whereas someone who wishes to add content because they believe it to be accurate and in the best public interest to distribute will eventually give up.  Whatever the case, I hope a disinterested third party will make a judgement so I can move on.

I have submitted to you, the site, sources, page numbers, and even posted the actual articles in which these facts are stated.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENEither you don't bother to read them, or you read them but ignore them because you are so biased in your beliefs that you only include facts that support them, and in some cases you lie altogether. How in god's name you are allowed to continue to be a Wikipedia editor is beyond me.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou basically quote two sources in the PIRA article...CAIN research, and Lost Lives. CAIN research is a ``estimated`` source of information. Jane's Intelligence, the US State Dept, and the Council On Foreign Relations...all use official statistics for their information, they do not ``estimate`` casualties as CAIN does.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs for Lost Lives...I have the latest edition of that book, and if you go through it page by page, you come up with the Loyalist casualty figures and British Security Service figures, i have put in the article. Either you are not really reading the book, or your are just lying about the figures, because you know they don't support your beliefs.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou also misquote other books. For instance ``The Irish War`` staates that 46 Loyalist Paramilitaries were killed by the IRA between 1986-1997...you state in your article that this is the TOTAL number of Loyalists killed by the IRA, that isn't true. The IRA killed a further 38 Loyalists between 1974-1986, but of course you leave that part out. I don't know if you are some Loyalist sympathizer or what, but the way in which you continually ignore the facts about how many UDA and UVF members were killed by the IRA seems odd to me. I have given SEVERAL different sources for this number. Books like ``The Irish War`` or the latest edition of ``The IRA A History`` by Tim Pat Coogan. Jane's Intelligence, the US State dept. ``Patterns Of Global Terrorisim`` and the Center For Strategic and international studies. Why these highly regarded sources aren't enough for you, I am not sure...unless you are trying to push an agenda.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAll of the above sources agree on the number and breakdown of the British Security service people killed bu the IRA over the 30 year war.

No problem about Patton, it happens. ) In regards to Maghakian's infobox, the infobox is meant to be a quick summary of information about the person, containing only key information succinctly. The ribbon icons, in my opinion, detract from the information, serve to clutter the infobox and are not the correct place for them to be. I know you pointed out the case of the John Shalikashvili article, but I think the ribbons presented in such a way in the infobox in that case is unhelpful and a waste as most people will not know what each of the ribbons denote and will have to either hover over them or click on them to find out, which should not have to be the case: it should be presented just there. The article is the place where extensive information and detail is intended to be discussed, as you have done in Maghakian, but not too much information placed in the infobox. As for the service medals, as noted above the awards section of the infobox is only meant to relate the notable awards one received, and not service medals. Maghakian is notable for his awards of the Navy Cross, Silver Star, Bronze Star and Purple Heart (the ones that should most definitely be listed in the infobox). If he had just received the service medals like everyone else who had served in his unit or the same theatres of war that he did, then he would not actually be notable enough for inclusion here. I think you would be better off expanding the awards section of the article and keeping the infobox succinct. Cheers,     : EDATA_8",test,0,-1

It is encyclopedic and  not factually incorrect if it states at the top of the page the the winners from 1952-1967 are the winners of the Best Foreign Award. The Best Foreign winners are winners from many different countries and the Best British winners are obviously all British and most from British films, so I feel they are very different and should be on separate pages.

Rather, he was not responding, because he had been caught doing 'drive-by edits'.   Dodo 'ran away', and he let his minions cover his ass while he ran.

Although relationships across racial lines were tolerated among the servant class in early colonial days, Virginia officials later moved to outlaw them. In the mid-1700s, the free colored families of Virginia migrated together, with other European colonists, into the interior of North Carolina. Researcher Paul Heinegg noted numerous families identified as mulattos, many with characteristically Lumbee names, in the 1768-1770 tax lists for Bladen County, from which Robeson County was formed.

I was an 18yr. old replacement and a member of Company D, 145th Infantry Regiment when we were sent deep into the Cagahan(Sp?) Valley of Northern Luzon with the assignment to thwart the fleeing soldiers of Japan from reaching the dense forested hills bordering that Valley. Our Company was engaged in many firefights with these retreating Japanese army units. My last combat missions were ended soon after the Dropping of the atomic bombs on the Japanese main land in early August. While my combat experience was very limited, I did come face-to-face with my own mortality during these few months of combat experience. When I came home in 1946, I remember the resentment I felt that my parents had to come with me before I could register to vote in my first National election. I was still under the legal voting age of 21.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn another subject, the Name of Medal of Honor winner, John J. Petrarcal is new to me.

148329006.0,"SDATA_8 :  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI am glad you are working on a rewrite and I will be glad to help out. There are 2 problems I see with what you are doing so far. One is that you really can't tell this story without a little historical context and in particular you can't leave out Morgan and the fruit fly work (and the change in the perception of what mutation was and how it affected the genetic variability of the populstion from the ideas of the earlier Mendalians such as De Vries). So at some point something about it has to go back in. The other is that most modern historians of science (Larson, Bowler, Gould) treat the foundation of population genetics as the start (Gould calls it the first phase) of the modern synthesis, not part of the run up to it. I realize this view differs somewhat from the view of Mayr who emphasizes more the later parts of the synthesis that involved the integration of other fields of biology with population genetics as the actual synthesis, but on this point I think, the article needs to follow the views of most current historians of science rather than those of Mayr or the other participants. There is a reason why historians do not rely exclusively on first person accounts of the participants in an event, and the biggest has to do with perspective.

My problem with this is that it is not a, um, well known publication, and as such would not likely be reviewed by any newspapers or such. Is there anything I can do (or in other words, what kind of external sources do I need?) to get my article back on Wikipedia? How can I get somebody that you define as reliable to verify that Westside, umm, exists? It just doesn't seem fair that I can't write an article about Westside just because the New York Times doesn't write about it. I thought the purpose of Wikipedia was to make information available to anyone who wants it. Several of Westside's readers have approached Wyatt (the co-creator) about a website to learn more about it, and, as of yet, he has no website to point them to. When he asked me to create a site about it (he's not great with these things) I of course immediately thought ``What better than Wikipedia?`` Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of the difficulty of putting a simple article up on Wikipedia. I won't deny that this has made me very angry. Is there ANY way for me to get my article back up? There's pretty much no chance that anything like a newspaper will cite Westside. Is there some kind of other source that I can get to review Westside? Also, why was my article initially cited as an attack article? It seemed obvious to me that my description of Tucker and Jason were not in any way insulting, as their apparent lack of intelligence is a character trait.

What I'm saying is, section breaks and paragraph breaks are similar, the question is when to use one vs the other. Paragraph breaks provide logical breaks in the content. In this case there is a new section header at the top of almost every paragraph, which is redundant, that's what paragraphs are made for. By adding those section headers, I believe, it chops up the article which discourages reading it as a single block of text from top to bottom, and encourages skimming and skipping, like reading an outline that hasn't been filled in, or a ``list of`` sort of thing, rather than a chronological and somewhat inter-related history of the origin of the high five. If we thought those origin theories were going to be greatly expanded.. say 4 or 5 or more paragraphs each.. I could see section headers making more sense, but until then, I believe it reads better as a single block of text. Green Cardamom (talk) NEWLINE_TOKEN:I see what you're saying, but I disagree. I think it looks better the way it is now, especially with the long block quote in the first section. I mean, the other option to me is bullets, but I think we both would agree that's not that aesthetically pleasing. Without some kind of division, it makes it harder to see that the three options are mutually exclusive, or arose independently at best. Without the divisions, in my opinion, it sounds like one origin narrative that all together led to the high five, rather than three separate possibilities.   `  : EDATA_8",test,0,-1

The simplest and most important reason is that aside from it's function as a thyroid hormone thyroxine is simply a chemical compound that should have its own article. For instance, go look at the triiodothyronine page and you'll see the standard chemical description page there with molecular weight, chemical formula, IUPAC name, etc. - a wealth of information uninteresting to and therefore absent from the thyroid hormone page this link now redirects to. The original thyroxine page should be restored with all of this chemical information. Regarding some of the above discussion - it is true that thyroxine produced in the thyroid can be either enantiomer and that the isolated levo-thyroxine enantiomer is what is in the drug. This is specifically interesting because levothyroxine can only be converted to ``normal`` T3, not ``reverse`` T3 - which is the other enantiomer. This has physiological consequences for those on the drug. So I think this is good information that we should add to the Thyroxine page once it is restored - but I don't think a separate page is needed for that. We just need the separate Thyroxine page back to have a place for that information to go - along with all of the now absent chemical information since merger with the Thyroid Hormones article.

Secondly, if you are talking about ``all commercial general aviation companies`` you are including such companies world-wide.  The number of aircraft produced by the world's general aviation companies is unlikely to be known with any accuracy because, outside North America, Europe and other English-speaking countries, aircraft manufacturers don't report their production statistices to anyone, and are not obliged to do so.  I suggest the sentence should say:NEWLINE_TOKEN:*The number of VanGrunsven-designed homebuilt aircraft produced each year exceeds the combined production of all commercial general aviation companies in North America.NEWLINE_TOKEN: '''' `  : EDATA_8",test,0,-1

151818137.0,"SDATA_8 :  `I am not sure. If the word ``denialist`` is new (which it is), you are unlikely to find a source calling an organization 100 or 150 years ago ``denialist``. You might find all the characteristics of what denialism is of course. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt depends on how you define denialism. If we define it very narrowly, we will only end up with 1 or 2 topics in the category of denialism, which clearly is wrong given the similarities of human behavior in those one or two areas with those in other subjects. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI believe we should do what dictionaries do when they define a word: we look at prominent sources like the New York Times, the New York Review of Books, the London Times, the Economist, the Wall Street Journal, Academic  journals, scholarly writing, popular novels, etc to see how the word is used. For a new word, this determines its meaning, until a family of dictionary editors codifies this set of meanings as a family of different definitions that are published in dictionaries. Since we are not yet at the dictionary publication stage, but at the earlier pre- dictionary publication stage, we have to do more of the hard work ourselves. That is all. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is clearly a common word, in common usage, at least in some subject areas. One rarely hears the word ``AIDS denier`` although that is essentially what an ``AIDS denialist`` is (parenthetically noting that in fact an AIDS denialist is really an ``HIV denialist``, properly speaking). And I suspect the phrase ``Holocaust denier`` will fade from usage now that the new word ``denialist`` seems to be gaining popularity. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf one maintains that there are two separate groups, denialists and deniers, then why are there no AIDS deniers? Why no HIV deniers? Only denialists? Seems a bit strange, given that human behavior is not much different in all these cases; only the topic changes. The denying stays the same. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf putting someone in a denialism category constitutes libel, then a very large number of publications worldwide have put themselves in legal jeopardy by publishing articles on AIDS denialists and other kinds of denialists. Given that these publications have full time legal staff and large legal budgets, and the people making these claims on Wikipedia are not lawyers or legal experts, this claim seems dubious at best. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf we accept the gratuitous personal assertions of some that denialism is really a political movement that involves personal gain, then creationists, creation scientists and intelligent design promoters fall in this category. If ``denialism`` is more like denial of the evidence, then this is less obviously true, since there is a dispute about the evidence in these cases. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf we define ``denialism`` as some here claim, to only mean those that know they are lying about the truth, then where does that leave the most common usage of the word in the phrase ``AIDS denialism`` ? It obviously cannot mean ``lying knowingly`` in this case, or probably in all cases. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI suggest that if one requires a publication to directly make the claim that ``X is a Y``, to put some article in a category, then we would depopulate most of the categories on Wikipedia. If Y has characteristics {Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4...Yn} from dictionary definitions or from common usage, and this common usage is well-understood and evident from publication in WP:V and WP:RS sources as defined above, and if X has most if not all of the characteristics {Y1, Y2, Y3...Yn}, then surely X can be put in the category Y. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor example, suppose we define a new type of urban area called a ``Townlet``, being an area with a common administration within a radius of 5 kilometers and a permanent human population of 5000-10000 people. Then one surely does not need a publication to state that ``Filllsberg is a Townlet`` to put Filllsberg, meeting all the necessary criteria, in the category ``Townlet``. NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENI also vehemently deny the assertion that ``denialist`` is a singularly negative category and so should not be used. If so, we would get rid of a large number of categories, such as ``pseudoscience``. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso, as I have stated repeatedly, ``transhumanists`` or ``secular humanists`` or ``aetheists`` might be viewed as denialists by some. And might feel perfectly proud to proclaim themselves as denialists of some overwhelming belief or putative evidence. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFor these reasons, I think there is nothing wrong with having a category called ``denialist``, or ``denialism``. The membership of this category might be controversial, depending on what we take as the definition of the word. Any particular subject might or might not be put in that category, given community consensus on the word's definition, and on the individual case by case analysis of any particular topic, subject or article.

If we add that there were 22,000 Italians in Somalia in that year and the aproximate population of Italian Somalia was calculated in 750,000 (there were no exact census), we have to agree to what writes Tripodi: 62,000 catholics in Italian Somalia (to whom we have to add the temporary Italian troops stationed in forts), or nearly 10% of the total population of 750,000. Of course there are other calculations of the 1940 population of Italian Somalia without the Ogaden, but most scholars agree in the 750,000 - 800,000 range.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have written that 'The Italian Embassy calculated in 1993 that most Italian colonists used to have illegitimate children with Somali women and this fact has created a group of Italian Somalians with Italian roots, that now amount to nearly 50,000 descendants in all Somalia', because in page 38 Paolo Tripodi wrote the following:L'ambasciatore italiano considerava l'uso del concubinato un serio problema durante gli anni della colonia. Un problema che aveva generato -secondo lui- quasi 50.000 Somali con almeno un nonno o bisnonno italiano negli anni novanta.

Natural selection works on the phenotype, the outward form determined by genes (the genotype), the environment and the interaction between them. Only heritable variations in a trait will be passed on to the next generation and the frequency of favourable heritable traits will increase in subsequent generations. The underlying genetic variation in traits is the result of genetic processes, such as mutations and recombinations, and can undo the effect of natural selection if strong enough relative to the effect of natural selection. Natural selection, together with other mechanisms such as genetic drift and mutations, is an important component of evolution, a cornerstone of modern biological and medical research.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::The term was introduced by Charles Darwin in 1859 in his book ``The Origin of Species``, as an analogy with a farmer choosing individuals that possess desired characteristics for his breeding stock, which Darwin called artificial selection.NEWLINE_TOKEN-NEWLINE_TOKENMaybe you find it not god, and in that case, I am curious what you think of that.

You mention that the article was ``already reviewed by admins and approved for inclusion in Wikipedia``.  I tried to make clear the purpose of my edit in the edit summary, but I guess I didn't do a good enough job.  I read through the AFD, the DRV, and the past deletions to get an idea of what was going on.  AFD/DRV were able to determine the notability of the article, but you hit it right on in your comment to me that in it's past state the article wasn't much more than a product sheet, which to me is synonymous with advertising.  Wikipedia articles aren't about features lists or product offerings, they are about bringing together neutral, third-party-verified information about topics.  As I'm sure you've seen I rearranged the page a little more since.  I have no problem with the screenshots or product names & descriptions, so I tried several things which display that information in a little bit more standard Wikipedia.

I am also an admin, but that just gives me the ability to work on more technical aspects of the project).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou are welcome to expand on the article as it is now, but it would be preferable to do it by gathering information from the many third-party sources listed.

In the future, it might be worthwhile listing separately the desktop and the web-based products, but not while there is only enough information for one article.

Most x86 OS only running within protectected mode such as Windows NT, Linux, and so many BSD distros; but MS-DOS working under real mode, some extender might switch through and back from protected mode for extending physical memory addressing, likewise, Windows 3.x also transit itself from real mode and protected mode thorugh and ack too. Windows 9x not only depends the real mode as bootstrap, but also sits itself from and to that mode. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLong Mode is a kind of protected mode, not a real mode, but does not belong to the Protected Mode in IA-32, switches itself out of IA-32 dominated Legacy Mode, to a completely self-contained mode, which means even though a x64 processor eliminates its legacy part, it would be fulfunctioned. From the aspect of implementation, or Microarchitecture level, the legacy mode codes could share the same physical execution resources designed for the x64 codes, without needing additional physical execution units for itself, like it found in early Itanium processor. So IA-32 architecture might or might not have relationship with x86-64, x64, AMD64 or Intel64. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN=== IA32e and AMD64 ===NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAMD64 is a switched-out architecture from IA-32, providing compatibility mode to support most IA-32 software and representing itself in the Long Mode within AMD64 processors.

Intel EM64T is the new brought feature to this kind of processors, enabling it for 64-bit computing. Of course, EM64T is not a mode too, but a feature like PAE, could be enabled to extend the 64-bit computing capability. Without EM64T enabled, Yamhill processor would act like a tradtional Pentium 4. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAfter EM64T enabled, 64-bit registers would be visible to applications. 32-bit traditional OS might need minor fixes to support applications referring 64-bit registers to do the 64-bit computings, but programmers must take care of the computing results without intervented by other processes. But most likely as it in PAE, OS might need a patch to support this feature totally, at least to manage the extended descriptors and extended 64-bit registers and stacks and so forth, but without needing to compile the OS from the scratch like it in AMD64. Virtual Address might be extended up to 52 bits, while physical address up to 46 bits. 16K segments of 4GiB could be spreaded to 64TiB physical space, with or without paging. Because the difference between 32bit and 64bit computing is bit width of register rather than the whole system, so 32-bit and 64-bit codes is also differentiated by the referenced resgistered without needing a submode, such as compatibility mode to support tradtional 32-bit software.

Sources for 2000s (decade) do not, in fact, have to be explicitly about the decade. They can be about, say, events that happened at some point during the decade. For example, a retrospective source about the 21st century, published before 2010, almost certainly is acceptable as a source about the 2000s. It is, after all, from these types of sources that time lines are constructed. Beneath my cynical tone (as it strikes me now in retrospect) was the idea that one can't infer too much from sources, as such inference might amount to original research. If a source says that X is characteristic of the 21st century or of modernity in general, that source (at least in principle) certainly may be used to help put the 2010s decade (insofar as it is part of the 21st century and of modernity) into context. Statement X just shouldn't be used clearly to characterize item A on Wikipedia, when it clearly is meant to characterize item B in the source.

The fan was indeed handicapped, but he was also hurling vile words at Cobb, who wouldn't put up with it. His teammates went on a one-day strike, then came back when told they would be banned from baseball if they didn't. Cobb did not escape suspension, he served it. The allegations against Cobb and Speaker in the mid-1920s came from another ballplayer, about a game several years earlier. It was that one player's word against theirs, hence insufficient evidence. Landis didn't hesitate to punch out the big stars (like Ruth) when it seemed warranted. The stats for Jackson in the '19 Series don't suggest he did anything much to help his team win. I don't know that he denied throwing the Series, some sources claim that. But did he keep the money? Far as I know, he did.

But then again, a theory need not be academic to be notable. For example, print and television journalists and their readers and viewing audiences can deem things notable as well. Nor do academics have a monopoly on logical or factual correctness, scholarly integrity, or intellectual merit, except possibly in the well-indoctrinated minds of some academics themselves (and of course, their aspiring apprentices, whose eager anticipation of scholastic glory sometimes inflates their academic snobbery to blimpish proportions).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Byrgenwulf complains that ``we chaps`` are not the sole arbiters of what belongs in the article. This is correct. To his credit, he invites others to tag his assertions. However, this is a bit specious, for having belatedly come to the realization that he has no relevant, verifiable assertions to make, he is now specializing in challenging the assertions of others. Thus, we now find him imperiously and rather comically demanding that every one of Langan's assertions receive a separate citation, when this is flatly unnecessary because the source material in which those assertions are made is already directly linked to the article. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::It is important for Byrgenwulf to understand that he has exactly the same burden of proof as his opponents. Not only must he provide a legitimate citation for anything he wishes to add to the article, but given that the article already links to ample source material, anything he wants to remove or qualify must be proven false, irrelevant, or non-neutral. Unfortunately, he hasn't yet been able to lock onto this signal. He still labors under the assumption that like some sort of Ultimate Bureaucrat, he can sit at his keyboard and demand an infinite amount of verification without verifying anything himself.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::By now, everyone involved in this matter has come to a stark realization: neither Byrgenwulf, nor any of his tiny but dedicated band of confederates, HAS any citations or other sources of verification for their own accusations. They are merely using the article, which is faithful to the material it cites, to prosecute their philosophical bias against its topic, the CTMU, which was deemed notable and newsworthy by several international periodicals and news networks. They do not like what the CTMU says; the article on the CTMU reports on what the CTMU says, and what Langan and the press say about the CTMU; hence, they do not like the article on the CTMU. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::This conflation of the article with the theory is reflected in Byrgenwulf's transparent strategy of attacking the theory through the article, attempting to dispose of the message by killing the messenger. Meanwhile, he seemingly fails to register the fact that he is himself in glaring violation of Wikipedia verifiability policy, and that his all-too-evident editorial bias is in massive violation of NPOV as well. Oozing contempt, Byrgenwulf has rumbled into the middle of the CTMU article with a load of summary demands, snide remarks, and self-righteous, factually worthless criticism...but not one relevant citation in hand! Nothing he says is verifiable; as we have now repeatedly seen, he cannot even be trusted on matters in which he claims to be an expert.

51906402.0,"SDATA_8 :  I have only just noticed that you are changing the names from common to scientific because you are starting to do the Australian snakes (all of which I am watching). You do have a good argument, although I do not fully agree. The problem is that you are not going about it the wrong way. Since it is policy, you should be first trying to change the policy before mass changes to the encyclopadia. The policies are there to create consistency. All you are doing now is making it more confusing. People expect to find the common names on Wikipedia, because that is the way it is done at the moment. Also, it seems you haven't read the Tree of Life guidelines properly. In it, it says that common names should be used where there are formal common names (such as birds) or there is a relatively unique common name. Otherwise use the scientific names. For example: White's Tree Frog is unique, and therefore the common name should be used. However, if you look at Litoria chloris, the common name cannot be used. Its common name, the Red-eyed Tree Frog has a disambigous page, explaining why that common cannot be used, and states that Red-eyed Tree Frog is not unique. NEWLINE_TOKEN::The entire issue is trying to account for the most ammount of people. If someone wants information on a snake, writes its common name into the search box, and comes across an article with a strange latin name, they may be off-put and think they wrote the wrong name, and it redirected to the wrong place. Especially if the article did not have a photo. If a scientist wants to look at an article, and puts in the scientific name, and it is redirected to the common name, they will be aware of what the common name is. In fact, you will find that in most scientific papers, they will use the common name, stating the scientific name once in brackets so their is no ambiguity. A lot of articles use the scientific name because their is no common name. There is no other choice, and there is no problem with this. NEWLINE_TOKEN::Please, bring this up on WP:TOL talk page before changing any more articles. You cannot create consistency yourself, and all you are doing is making it worse. If policy is changed other people can help, and it is possible to get all the articles changed. Policy needs to be followed, otherwise the encyclopaedia becomes a jamble. Thankyou.

305950707.0,"SDATA_8 :  `:::::: The numbers are indeed possible. First is that the numbers from the 1997 election cannot be used to compare to the current one becuase this was before the point in which the youth would take on a much bigger position than they did today. the conservatives were still around and the youth could not vote then, but now the youth can vote and the conservatives have either died or changed to rather anti-Ahmadinejad. The conservative candidate was nothing like ahmadinejad so he could have had a good 8 million votes. And if you add Rezaee votes with it it comes around 9 million for the consevatives in total. 60% of iran is under 30, and they only know problems under this regime or more specifically, this administration. Besides Ahmadinejad is massively unpopular and the numbers from his previous election are going to decrease because of the increase in sanctions and further isolation from the rest of the world. YOu cannot think that his approval will go up because the nuclear program was started long before ahmadinejad, he just publicized it and his threats against Israel further promoted them, He makes useless provocations against the Holocaust, going as far enough to invite David Duke to tehran to talk about it, and this is not going to promote him very well. Next, most of the programs in Iran were started in the Khatami or even Rafsanjani administration. so the fact the claim that he is supporting the poor is dubious and the Iranians realize this because he has slowed them down or stopped them wholly, in order to pay russia or the military. And he has also placed Gas rationing on one of the largest producers of oil in the world. Point, being Ahmadinejad is not going to be quite popular, even within the conservative corners of the government. Karroubi is popular where ahmadinejad supposedly is so I dont see anything wrong with his votes and the upper class and middle class are going to vote for mousavi. Some of the lower class are going to vote for mousavi since they remember his handeling of the economy in the 80's so that will give him lots of extra votes. Rezaee is still really hated due to his running of the revolutionary guard in the 80's. And do you think that the government was going to tolerate a runoff between two reformists that each got more votes than the conservatives combined. Absolutely not in a million years. So the numbers are reasonable as mentioned above. Next is that you cannot rely on polls in Iran or whatever any government group is going to say. The polls that are ``official`` are made by the government. you know what I mean. and the groups (the islamic participation front) cannot know the exact extent of their popularity because the people fear evin if the open their mouths.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSecond point is that i might have contradicted myself earlier. Any memo that is made by the government is going to have the seal on it, making it offical, period. It does not have any numbers in order to prevent trails as I mentioned Earlier. NEWLINE_TOKENIm going to leave this on the page. The first reason is that the letter, wheather fake or not, is being widely circulated around Iran, so it is being used as a catalyst to the protests. The second is that Wikipedia is not a forum in order to determine wheather or not a document is fake or not, If the document is of encyclopedic value, as it is being actively used within the situation as it is in the protests it should be kept. wheather it is fake or not, It is evidence that is being actively used there is vote rigging,  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_8",test,1,-1

I must imagine that if you don't understand why the template is inadequate then you have not the faintest idea of what constitutes pscyhology. It is a) an academic (taught) discipline, b) a research discipline, c) an applied discipline, d) a profession, interest group and lobby e) a property of of social perception or a folk psychology if you like and f) an aspect of the humanities and the social sciences as well as a peer of psychiatry, social work and in some respects occupational therapy; g) a contested political terrain (which you would understand if a non-amateur had written the articles on critical psychology and cultural-historical psychology). Neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions. Instead what you have is a bad summary of a first year textbook of an American perspective on the psychodynamic-post- Skinnerian model of psychology circa 1950s. Having to explain this and to persuade you is hardly what someone with advanced expertise in the area wants to be doing on a Saturday afternoon. It is insulting, demoralizing and a waste of time.

In conclusion more powerful engines were logically not needed.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Correct, they didn't ``need`` more powerful engines in 1908, but were probably glad to have them. However, your conclusion that therefore their statements about their previous flights are ``their own fiction`` is merely your own fanciful opinion, to which you're entitled, but which flies in the face of more than 100 years of published information and, yes, the WB own documentary proof, undisputed by all reputable historians. The 1-minute 45-second flight you mentioned was Wilbur's very first in France; about a month later he flew 90 minutes (after Orville had made hour-long flights in the U.S.).   NEWLINE_TOKEN:::: I base all my affirmations on primary sources and not latter judgements.

I've subsequently tagged the article, to see if anyone could take a look and see if they can do anything about it. Cheers.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWell, according to the article:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN...the SCCRC concluded its four-year review and, having uncovered evidence that a miscarriage of justice could have occurred...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo, giving some considerable weight to doubts about his guilt would be justified.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:That is true, but it stands that he is a convicted mass murderer who took the lives of hundreds of people. To have the majority of the article weighted towards his alleged innocence/appeals etc seems disproportionately biased in his favour. While I know that there is obviously a distinct article on the bombing, it doesn't quite seem appropriate that the article about the guilty party is leaning heavily towards innocence. In light of the dropping of the appeal, it seems somewhat unlikely that he will be exhonerated, so it's not even as if Megrahi's status, in a legal sense, will alter (in terms of innocent vs guilty, rather than incarcerated vs free). I'm not sure what to do to alter the article, which is why I tagged it, to see if anyone else had any ideas. I accept entirely what you're saying, and I even agree, I just, like I said, find that focus disproportionate.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::This legal speak is very cautious. ``A miscarriage of justice could have occurred`` means in reality that it is practically certain that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. So, he is convicted, yes, but a mass murderer, no, the guilty party, no, most likely not. Concerning the future, nobody knows, but there remains a strong pressure to reopen the case.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::My understanding of the legal status is that ``A miscarriage of justice could have occurred`` does not, by any stretch, mean that the occurrence of such a miscarriage is ``practically certain.``  If you have evidence to that effect, I would be happy to see it.  It only means that there is sufficient reason to justify the time and expense of further investigation.  We should also be wary of political pressures on the relevant actors in this case, coming from both directions, and to me this diminishes the weight of several quotations in favor of al-Megrahi; there was significant pressure on law enforcement agencies to put someone away for the Lockerbie bombing, and just as surely there was just as much pressure on Libya and its friends to exonerate him, due to the sanctions and damage to international reputation and etc.  This is why I think less weight should be given to quotations and more weight to the hard evidence. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Perhaps the article would read a little less biased if it actually included some of the relevant points from the original case against him? It doesn't really tell a reader why he was convicted in the first place.-  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::I absolutely agree.  First, the weight of the evidence in favor of a conviction should be given.  The page says nothing about what he is accused of doing and why the judges reached the conclusion they did.  Second, even though reasons have been given to doubt the conviction, responses to those reasons should also be given.  Presumably those who remain convinced of al-Megrahi's guilt, especially those who were involved in the initial trial, have offered responses to the allegations of a miscarriage of justice.  Al-Megrahi was convicted; this much is fact.  Voices should be heard that believe the conviction was wrong, and voices should be heard that believe it was right.

I have two problems: first, it moves too easily from science as a generic activity all people engage in, to science as a specifically Western project.  Second, although there has been progress in science in that there is some accumulation of knowledge, the history of science is rather more complicated than that.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne way to deal with this (if others find my criticisms valid) is to distinguish in the article between what we know about changes in scientific method and knowledge (from Aristotle to Bacon to Comte to Popper; from Aristotle to Darwin to Mendel to Mayr; from Aristotle to Newton to Einstein and Planck; etc, on the one hand, and various discussions over how to study and conceive of the history of science (i.e. issues in historiography and the sociology of science), on the other.  For example, I think everyone agrees that Aristotle, Newton, Einstein and Planck are real people who lived at different periods of time and made different claims about the world  but I think different people have vastly different ways of telling the story that connects these people and their claims.

Articles have to be of enough general interest for an encyclopedia article: the Wikipedia term for that is notability, and the requirements are explained in the guideline on Notability and in more detail in Notability (organizations and companies). Articles need to be verifiable from independent, reliable sources - a company's own website does not count as independent - and independent references are the best way to demonstrate notability. Also, articles must be written from a neutral point of view, and so people are strongly discouraged from writing about themselves or their own organizations, because of the conflict of interest involved. If you do write on such subjects, follow the advice in NEWLINE_TOKENWhen writing about subjects that are close to you, don't use your own personal knowledge of the subject, and don't cite yourself, your web site, or the subject's web site.
